# My Data Scientist Journey
Follow me on my journey to becoming an expert data scientist

about 4 months ago since I embarked on this journey, there have been many challenges. 

Nov-Dec,2018/January 2019-  I have so far taken a course in Introduction to Data Science from the John Hopkins  university. I have been introduced into the world of R programming and the likes and have obtained a certificate of completion. 

January 2019-   I am presently taking courses from the WorldQuant University and preparing to begin a Masters in Financial Engineering
....but......**a major hiccup.**..my computer broke down and repairing proved abortive....need to buy a new computer...presently saving money to buy a new one( a fairly used actually..lol)

A long interlude from my last update in 2019. I finally got 2 laptops. Then COVID happened. 

2021- I took several online courses again in Python. I can say that I am an Intermediate Python user.

2022 - The big break. I was admitted into the 1-year Explore Data Science Accelerator Program @ www.explore-datascience.net. A very immersive experience.
My dream is finally taking a great shape. So far I am adept at using Python, Power BI, SQL. I am presently on Machine Learning with Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.
