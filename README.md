# My Data Scientist Journey
Follow me on my journey to becoming an expert data scientist

about 4 months ago since I embarked on this journey, there have been many challenges. 

Nov-Dec,2018/January 2019-  I have so far taken a course in Introduction to Data Science from the John Hopkins  university. I have been introduced into the world of R programming and the likes and have obtained a certificate of completion. 

January 2019-   I am presently taking courses from the WorldQuant University and preparing to begin a Masters in Financial Engineering
....but......**a major hiccup.**..my computer broke down and repairing proved abortive....need to buy a new computer...presently saving money to buy a new one( a fairly used actually..lol)
